to get the simulator to run only 1 robot we should change animal_c_rough_config
    we need to make "num_envs = 1# instead of 4096"

    then without using --headless we can see the robot train 
    - one robot uses 7 gigs of vram. 

for assets/stuff in the simulator: 

in isaacgym there are urdf nad mjcf libraries 

questions: 
1. why does running a1 give a segmentation fault? 
2. does it matter if we just make the environment w/o the robot or with anymalC? 

3. how to make an environment? can we do it by hand or should we do it with a python script? 

GPU memory comes from actor_critic.py in rsl_rl/rsl_rl/modules
- you can just decrease the NN size [128,128], [128,128]


we want to try to add assets the way that the balls are added in /home/theotourneux/isaac_gym/isaacgym/python/examples/1080_balls_of_solitude.py

- to do this we need to figure out how the assets are being loaded 


inheritance for anymal_c_flat.
    - anymal_c_flat inherits from anymal_c_rough which inherits from LeggedRobotCfg which inherits from BaseConfig
